    "# Problem set 2: Hands on with sustainability models\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem set will have you work through several sustainability models. To turn this in, please submit a PDF of your completed notebook and upload to the assignment on canvas. There are lots of ways to convert a completed Jupyter Notebook to PDF, including the Export feature in VS Code in the \"...\" options menu above this notebook. The most robust way is to use Quarto (https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started.html), which I had you install as a VS Code Extension. The easiest way to do that is open up a Command Prompt/Terminal in the folder where your notebook is and type `quarto render problem_set_2.ipynb --to pdf`. This will create a PDF in the same folder as your notebook.\n"

    "Use the init methods, but ensuring you use the correct damage function parameter. Calling the .init_parameters() method with no arguments gives you the default parameters, but you can overwrite the default by passing specific values like this: `dice.init_parameters(alpha=0.2, eta=0.3)`. You will want to change the exponent in the damage function. If you can't figure out what coefficient it is, you can learn this by poking around in the dicelib.py file. To get the total damages at the right year, you will have to inspect the model outputs and call the right year out of the list. You can access an element in a list like this: `my_value = my_list[0]`. Remember that python is 0-indexed, so the first element is at index 0.\n"
